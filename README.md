# Tweetify - A Topic Searching App

Tweetify is a django web app which allows you to search tweets according to the topic you search for and perform sentiment analysis on each tweet to gauge the reaction of people towards the subject of interest. It uses the twitter API and tweepy python wrapper to search and fetch tweets and textblob library for sentiment analysis.
